|  DataBase     | Query      | DBSelectQuery1 |

# Query type is "Select" or "insert" or "Delete" or "update"
# the above should create execute the following query against the DB:
# select firstName from Profile where patId = '621456' and meId = '985478';
# If there is a value given in lookColumnValueValidation, then the step should only pass, if DB returns the value as given in this column
